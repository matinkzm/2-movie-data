# 2-movie-data

This is second project from this link : https://medium.com/@luisprooc/30-data-engineering-project-ideas-9ecf0a70cbea

In this project I created a small ETL data pipeline for movie data.

First I read the csv file , select the data i wanted and move it to dataframe and then into a csv file.

Extract = read the csv file
Transform = select movie name , year and its rating
load = movie it to the dataframe and then csv file
